Artificial Intelligence (AI) covers a range of techniques that appear as sentient behavior by the computer. For example, AI is used to recognize faces in photographs on your social media, beat the World’s Champion in chess, and process your speech when you speak to Siri or Alexa on your phone.

In this course, we will explore some of the ideas that make AI possible:


## 大纲

Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move.

### Knowledge 信息
Representing information and drawing inferences from it.

### Uncertainty 不确定性
Dealing with uncertain events using probability.

使用概率解决不确定性问题

### Optimization 优化
Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better—or the best—way to solve it.

寻找最好或者更好的方式去解决

### Learning 学习
Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience.

### Neural Networks 神经网络

### Language 语言
Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans.
